# 1. information gathering
In this section we will gather information about the web application, identify its functionalities and underlying technologies,and expand the potential attack surface to discover vulnerabilities.

## 1.1 Note: 
Tools like theHarvester, Shodan, or subdomain scanners are mainly used for OSINT across multiple targets (domains, networks, IPs, etc). And because OWASP juice is a single application on a local machine, automated OSINT tools will not give meaningfull results, So i will gather the information manually, Tools that rely on HTTP requests and response codes such as `Dirsearch` can still be usefull for discovering directories and files, and will be used as appropriate.

## 1.2 Overview
The OWASP juice shop is a web application simulating a juice e-commerce store. Users can browse products, place orders, and interact with the site, by analyzing the app, we can identify technologies and functionalities that may be leveraged for testing.

## 1.3 Application technology:
- Programming languages:
	- Node.js
	- TypeScript
- JavaScript frameworks:
	- Angular 20.2.3
	- Zone.js
- JavaScript libraries:
	- jQuery 2.2.4 
- Technologies & Features:
	- Vite: It bundles and serves the TypeScript code of the Juice Shop app.
	- PWA: makes the site installable and offline-capable.

## 1.4 Application Functionality
- Authentication:
	- Login with username/password or OAuth
	- Forgot password with reset link
	- Change Password
	- 2FA configuration

- Product browsing:
	- Search functionality with keyword filtering.

- User Profile:
	- File upload
	- Change username
	- Link profile image from URL

- Ordering 
	- Add products to the basket
	- Modify quantity in basket
	- Checkout (address + delivery speed)
	- Payment (wallet, saved options, etc..)

- Additional:
	- Request Data Export (JSON format with user details and orders)
	- Recycling Box
	- Saved addresses
	- Digital wallet
