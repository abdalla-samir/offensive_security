# 1.Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

## 1.1 Reflected XSS in search functionality

**Vulnerability**: Reflected XSS.

**Link**: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/#/search?q=`
 
### Summary
a reflected xss was discovered in the search functionality in OWASP Juice shop. The issue arises from insufficient sanitiztion of the user input, when an attacker injects a malicious payload such as `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>` in the search, the code is executed in the victim's browser

### Steps to Reproduce:
		1. Navigate to the main page of `OWASP juice shop`.
		2. Enter the following payload into the search bar: `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`.
		3. Press `Enter` and observe that the malicious code was executes successfully.
	
### Impact
 this type of vulnerability can be exploited using delivery methods such as social engineering. Once the victim clicks a crafted link, the malicious code injected by the attacker will be executed, this can lead to:
- Stealing the victim session cookie.
- Forcing the victim to perform unintended actions on the site without their knowledge (cross-site request forgery like behaviour)
